「戰鎚：殺戮小隊」遊玩使用的陣營資料，與官方APP差異在於，此應用網頁有針對手機螢幕尺寸進行優化，方便閱讀。
並新增以下便利功能：
1.武器則說明：可「直接點選武器規則」就可以看見解釋。
2.單位名稱後方可以記錄耐傷。
3.資料針對「非使用」的單位進行隱藏，方便遊玩時只閱覽上場單位。
4.對於回合內使用過的計謀，可以勾選已表示使用過。

殺戮小隊的各陣營都有販售實體的規則卡片，請多多支持臺灣戰鎚戰鎚店家並購買收藏，共同營造優質的遊玩環境。
本應用網頁APP非官方製作，如GW官方有更新規則，本作者會盡快同步更新資料，並公告。
本應用網頁APP內的資料，都是直接使用GW官方的文檔，本作者不做任何修正。
有任何規則爭議，請以GW官方公佈為準。

The faction data used for playing **Warhammer: Kill Team** differs from the official app in that this web application has been optimized for mobile screen sizes to make reading more convenient.

The following convenience features have also been added:

1. **Weapon Rule Descriptions:** You can directly tap on a weapon rule to view its explanation.
2. **Wound Tracking:** Remaining wounds can be recorded next to each unit’s name.
3. **Unit Filtering:** Units that are not in use can be hidden, allowing you to view only the units currently in play.
4. **Tactical Ploy Tracking:** Tactical ploys used during a turning point can be checked off to indicate they have already been used.

Each Kill Team faction has officially sold physical datacards. Please support local Warhammer stores in Taiwan by purchasing and collecting them, and help create a positive and high-quality gaming environment together.

This web application is not officially produced. If Games Workshop updates the rules, the author will synchronize the data as soon as possible and make an announcement.

All data within this web application is taken directly from official Games Workshop documents, and the author does not make any modifications.

In the event of any rules disputes, please refer to official Games Workshop publications as the final authority.
